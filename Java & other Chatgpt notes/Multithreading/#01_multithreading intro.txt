 🧵 Java Multithreading Basics (Beginner Notes)

 ✅ What is Multithreading?

* Multithreading means running multiple tasks at the same time.
* Each task runs in a separate thread (a small unit of a process).
* It helps to do more work in less time, especially useful for tasks like games, web servers, or background tasks.

---

 🔧 Why Use Multithreading?

* Better performance (especially on multi-core processors)
* Efficient use of CPU
* Handle multiple users or tasks smoothly
* Perform background tasks (e.g., loading files, animations)

 🧠 Key Terms

| Term            | Meaning                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread      | A path of execution inside a program                    |
| Process     | A program in execution (can have multiple threads)      |
| Concurrency | Multiple threads run "at the same time" (seemingly)     |
| Parallelism | Threads truly run at the same time (on multi-core CPUs) |

---
✅ What is a Process in Java (and in general)?
📌 Definition:
A process is an independent program in execution. It is the instance of a running application. Each process has its own memory space, resources, and system-level information.



| Aspect         | Process                                 | Thread                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Memory         | Has its own memory space            | Shares memory with other threads          |
| Communication  | Complex (IPC)                           | Easy (shared memory)                      |
| Cost           | Heavyweight                             | Lightweight                               |
| Failure Impact | One process crash doesn't affect others | Thread crash can affect the whole process |
| Speed          | Slower due to overhead                  | Faster to create and switch               |

 🧵 Creating Threads in Java

# ✅ 1. By extending Thread class

java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}


# ✅ 2. By implementing Runnable interface

java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start();
    }
}

 🔁 Important Thread Methods

| Method      | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| start()   | Starts the thread                          |
| run()     | Code inside this method runs in the thread |
| sleep(ms) | Pauses thread for given milliseconds       |
| join()    | Waits for thread to finish                 |
| isAlive() | Checks if thread is still running          |

---

 🚦 Thread Lifecycle (States)

New – Thread is created but not started

Runnable – Thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU

Running – Thread is actively executing / running

Blocked – Waiting to acquire a lock

Waiting/Timed Waiting – Waiting for another thread (e.g., join(), sleep())(e.g., for I/O or other thread)

Terminated (Dead) – Thread has finished execution



---

 ⚠️ Multithreading Issues

* Race condition: Two threads access the same data at the same time
* Deadlock: Two threads wait for each other forever
* Thread safety: When code works correctly even with multiple threads

---

 🔒 Synchronization

* Use synchronized keyword to avoid conflicts between threads:

java
synchronized void myMethod() {
    // only one thread can access this at a time
}


---

 ✨ Simple Real-World Example

* Loading a file while showing a progress bar
* Downloading multiple files at the same time
* A chat app receiving and sending messages at once
