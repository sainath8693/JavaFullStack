Is software developers are very smart and claver. I am currently working as a manual tester from last 9 months. I want to switch to the java developer. I have learned core java , sql , servlet, jsp and spring core. Only spring boot is pending. But still I am not getting cofidence. I am doubting on myselft will I do that. What will if I selected there and not able to do the work.

Thanks for opening up—what you’re feeling is completely normal. Many people go through similar doubts when shifting careers, especially into something like software development, which can seem overwhelming from the outside.

 First, let's address your question directly:

> "Are software developers very smart and clever?"

Not necessarily more than anyone else.
Good developers are *consistent learners*, *problem solvers*, and *comfortable with not knowing everything right away*. It's not about being a genius—it’s about building skills over time and not giving up when things get hard.

---

 Now, about your situation:

You’ve already done a lot:

✅ 9 months of experience in IT (manual testing – that *does* count!)
✅ You’ve learned Core Java, SQL, Servlet, JSP, and Spring Core
⬜ Still working on Spring Boot

That’s a *solid foundation* for a junior Java developer.

---

 But you're feeling stuck because of confidence. Here's why that’s normal:

1. Imposter Syndrome: This affects even experienced developers. You’re not alone.
2. Fear of Failing After Getting the Job: Totally valid. Many companies expect new developers to learn on the job, especially at entry level.
3. Comparing Yourself to Others: Maybe you’re seeing people who code fast or seem to “just get it.” But most of the time, they’ve been doing it longer than you.

---

 Let’s break it down: What if you *do* get selected and can’t do the work?

Here’s the honest truth:

* Every new developer feels like that at some point.
* Companies hiring junior developers know they’ll need guidance.
* If you’re honest, keep learning, ask questions, and show effort—you’ll grow into it.

And if a job really turns out to be a bad fit? That’s still okay. You’ll learn, and the next role will feel easier.

---

 Suggestions for Next Steps:

1. Finish Spring Boot – It's very important for most Java roles today. Build 1–2 small projects (like a blog app or task manager API).
2. Build Projects – Even simple apps show that you can connect frontend/backend, use a database, etc.
3. Practice Coding Problems – Use platforms like \[LeetCode Easy], \[HackerRank], or \[CodeSignal]. Not to become a DSA master—but to get used to writing code under pressure.
4. Apply Anyway – Confidence usually comes *after* taking action, not before. Apply to jobs even if you're scared.

---

 Final Words:

You can do this.
You don’t need to feel 100% ready to move forward. Nobody ever does.

You’re already learning, already trying—and that makes you more prepared than you think.

If you’d like, I can help you:

* Plan your Spring Boot learning
* Suggest some Java mini-projects
* Help review your resume for Java roles

Just let me know what you'd find most helpful right now.

In my current company I have not worked on any live projects just work on UAT environment. for 3 to 4 months. I have not consistent work. I guess I sit idle from last 4 to 5 months. No any testing and all. I have wasted a lot of time in this company.
==
I really appreciate your honesty here—and let me tell you, you’re not alone in this. Many people find themselves in similar situations, especially early in their careers or in companies where there isn't proper training or project allocation.

 Here's what I want you to understand first:

👉 You haven’t wasted your time.
Even if you weren’t actively doing testing work every day, you’ve gained:

* Exposure to a real IT environment
* Understanding how teams, deployments, and UAT environments work
* Time to learn Java, Spring, SQL, etc. (which is huge!)

You’ve also learned something very valuable: what kind of work you *don't* want to be doing. That’s progress too.

---

 Let’s address the key thoughts you're having:

# 1. "I haven’t worked on live projects."

That’s okay. For many junior roles, companies are looking at your potential, your skills, and your attitude. You don’t need a perfect resume—you need to show what you *can* do.

> ✅ Start building your own mini-projects—these *are* your live projects now.

---

# 2. "I sit idle from last 4 to 5 months."

That time can still become a stepping stone:

* You’ve already used some of that time to learn Java, Spring, etc.
* Now you can use the rest to build a small portfolio:

  * REST API in Spring Boot
  * A basic CRUD app with database connection
  * A login + registration system with validations

Even 2 good projects will make you feel confident and give you something solid to talk about in interviews.

---

# 3. "I have wasted a lot of time in this company."

Let’s reframe that:

* Maybe the company didn’t give you the best work.
* But you didn’t quit. You started learning.
* That’s the behavior of someone who’s going to succeed.

And now you know what kind of environment to look for in your next job.

---

 What You Can Do Starting Today

1. Finish Spring Boot – That’s the biggest thing you're missing.
2. Build 1–2 Java + Spring Boot Projects – These can be simple, but real:

   * Example: "Task Manager" app, or "Student Management System"
   * Add REST APIs, database (MySQL), use Postman to test
3. Put it on GitHub + LinkedIn
4. Start Applying to Entry-Level Java Developer Roles
5. Prepare Interview Basics

   * OOP, Exception Handling, Collections
   * SQL Queries (joins, group by, etc.)
   * Spring Core basics and annotations

---

 And about your self-doubt?

Yes, you had downtime—but now you’re choosing to move forward. That’s what makes a developer, not just the code.

If you want, I can:

* Suggest 2–3 project ideas for Java developers
* Help create a learning plan for Spring Boot
* Help you write your resume to highlight your learning + UAT work

Would you like help with any of these?

I am very silent and quiet like introwold. I don't talk with anyone. I haven't talk with any developers or observe them what work they do. I don't know how they work. I have learned the spring, servlet, jsp , from youtube. 
==
Thank you for sharing this—your openness really shows strength. Being an introvert or quiet person does not mean you can't become a successful developer. In fact, many great developers are exactly like you: calm, observant, thoughtful, and focused.

Let me walk you through this clearly.

---

## 🔹 First, being an introvert is *not a weakness*

Being quiet doesn't mean you can't:

* Solve problems
* Learn complex systems
* Write good code
* Be successful in a development role

It just means you might prefer:

* Deep focus over constant chatter
* Working independently
* Communicating in writing (like emails, chats, or comments)

These are valuable traits in software development.

---

## 🔹 “I haven’t talked with developers or observed how they work”

That’s okay. Most of us started from the same place.

Here’s how developers usually work, in simple terms:

| Activity                            | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Understanding requirements   | They read tasks or talk with leads about what needs to be built |
| 🧠 Thinking through the problem | They plan logic, data flow, and architecture                    |
| 💻 Writing code                 | Most of the time is spent here: Java, Spring, database queries  |
| 🧪 Testing it locally           | Using tools like Postman or unit testing libraries              |
| 📦 Pushing code                 | They use Git to commit and push code to a shared repository     |
| 🗣️ Review and feedback         | Code is reviewed by other developers before going live          |
| 📁 Deployment and bug fixing    | After testing, the feature goes live and is maintained          |

Most of this work is done individually or with minimal talking, especially in remote or quiet environments.

---

## 🔹 YouTube Learning is *completely valid*

Learning Spring, Servlet, JSP from YouTube shows initiative. Many developers—even senior ones—still use YouTube, Udemy, or freeCodeCamp.

It doesn’t matter where you learned it. What matters is:

* Can you build something with it?
* Can you explain what your code is doing?
* Can you keep learning and improving?

---

## 🔹 What You Can Do Next (Even as a Quiet Person)

Here’s a roadmap just for you:

 ✅ 1. Finish Spring Boot

* Build 1 or 2 simple REST APIs (like Todo App or Book Store)

 ✅ 2. Build a Project and Host it

* Use GitHub for code
* Use Render or Railway to deploy the backend (I can guide you)
* Add it to your resume and LinkedIn

 ✅ 3. Join Quiet Developer Communities

* Reddit: r/java, r/learnprogramming
* Discord servers or GitHub issues (mostly written communication)

 ✅ 4. Prepare for Interviews

* You don’t have to talk a lot—just practice clear, short answers
* Practice basic Java questions and Spring concepts

---

## 🔹 Final Thoughts: Your Personality Is Not a Barrier

Quiet people often become:

* Deep-thinking developers
* Great problem solvers
* Trusted team members

If you’re consistent and willing to learn (which you clearly are), you will make it.

You’ve already:

* Learned tough frameworks on your own
* Reflected deeply on your career
* Continued to push yourself even with self-doubt

That says more about your potential than anything else.

---

Would you like me to help you:

* Pick a simple project idea to build?
* Plan out your Spring Boot learning in steps?
* Prepare for job interviews as a quiet/introverted person?

Let’s take it step by step—you’re closer than you think.


==
Tell me the possible interview questions and their answers  based on my current company 
==
Absolutely — let’s focus on interview questions related to your current role as a Manual Tester with limited real-time project exposure, and how you can turn that into a strong story during interviews.

Since you’re transitioning to Java Developer, your goal is to show:

1. What you *have* done (even if in UAT),
2. What you *have learned* (Java, Spring),
3. And how motivated you are to grow into a developer role.

---

## ✅ Common Interview Questions (based on your background)

 1. Can you tell me about your current role and responsibilities?

Sample Answer:

> I’m currently working as a manual tester, mainly supporting the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment. I was responsible for executing test cases, reporting bugs, and validating bug fixes.
> However, due to limited active projects in the last few months, I took the opportunity to learn backend development — I’ve been focused on Core Java, SQL, JSP, Servlets, and Spring. I’ve also started building small Java-based projects to apply my learning.

---

 2. Why do you want to switch from testing to development?

Sample Answer:

> While working in QA, I realized I enjoy understanding how the backend works — how APIs respond, how the database is structured. I started learning Java out of curiosity and found I enjoy building logic and writing code more than just testing it. Now, I want to take that further and contribute as a backend developer.

---

 3. You mentioned you haven’t worked on a live project. How did you practice Java development?

Sample Answer:

> That’s correct, I haven’t had the chance to work on a live dev project yet. But I’ve built small projects on my own using Java, Servlets, JSP, and Spring Core. For example, I built a basic Student Management System where you can add, delete, and update student data using a MySQL database and simple JSP pages.
> I’m currently working on Spring Boot and planning to build RESTful APIs for a Todo or BookStore application.

---

 4. How do you keep yourself motivated when not much is going on in your current job?

Sample Answer:

> When my current role didn’t offer consistent work, I decided to use that time to upskill. I made a daily routine to study Java, watch tutorials, and practice coding problems. I believe we grow when we invest in ourselves, and that’s helped me stay motivated despite slow periods at work.

---

 5. Have you worked with developers directly in your current company?

Sample Answer:

> Not directly. My interaction was limited since I was mostly assigned independent testing tasks. However, I’ve read documentation and worked on tickets related to feature testing, which gave me exposure to the development flow.
> I’m excited to now work more closely with developers as I grow in this new role.

---

 6. Can you describe any challenges you’ve faced in your current role?

Sample Answer:

> One challenge was not having consistent tasks, which made it hard to stay engaged. But instead of waiting passively, I decided to grow technically. That helped me stay productive and develop skills that I now want to use in a full-time Java developer role.

---

## ✅ Technical Crossover Questions (They may ask these)

 7. How comfortable are you with writing SQL queries?

> I can write basic to intermediate SQL queries — SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and nested queries. In one of my projects, I used SQL with a Java backend to store and retrieve student records. I'm continuing to improve with hands-on practice.

---

 8. Have you written any Java code that interacts with a database?

> Yes. In a self-practice project, I used JDBC to connect a Java application to a MySQL database. I implemented CRUD operations like adding, deleting, and viewing data. I’m also learning how to do this using Spring JDBC and Spring Data JPA.

---

 9. Can you explain what a Servlet is?

> A Servlet is a Java class used to handle HTTP requests in a web application. It runs on the server, processes the client’s request, and sends back a response. It’s part of Java EE and is typically used in early-stage web applications, before frameworks like Spring came along.

---

 10. How is Spring different from Spring Boot?

> Spring provides the core framework for dependency injection and building modular applications, but it requires a lot of manual configuration.
> Spring Boot simplifies that by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and starter templates, making it faster to build and deploy applications with minimal setup.

---

## ✅ Final Advice

 Tailor your resume like this:

* Mention your testing experience honestly
* Add a “Personal Projects” section to list your Java/Spring work
* Highlight your learning initiative and technologies you're building with

---

Would you like me to:

* Help you list your project on a resume?
* Create a mock interview question set (Java/Spring focus)?
* Help write a better resume summary for your Java transition?

Let me know — you’re making real progress, and I’m here to help take the next step.
