default methods
- default methods have body
- from java 8 default methods are allowed in interface.
eg. default void sayHello()
{
	syso();
}
============
- create class and implement the interface now access the default method
- we can call default method of interface with the help of child class object ref.
- we can override default method
- if we have 2 interface with same method name , form arg, then we can not call them we get CTE.
