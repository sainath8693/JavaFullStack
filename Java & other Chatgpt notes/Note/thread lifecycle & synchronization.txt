The Java Thread Life Cycle refers to the different states that a thread can go through from its creation to its completion. Understanding the thread life cycle is essential for working with multithreading in Java. Here’s a simplified explanation of the thread life cycle in easy-to-understand terms:

 1. New (Born state):
- A thread is in the New state when it is created, but it has not yet started.
- This happens right after you create a new thread, but you haven’t called its `start()` method yet.

Example:
```java
Thread t = new Thread();
```
At this point, the thread is just created but hasn’t started running.

 2. Runnable (Ready to Run):
- After you call the `start()` method, the thread moves to the Runnable state. 
- In this state, the thread is ready to be picked by the thread scheduler and run. However, it may not actually be running yet because the scheduler decides which thread to execute next.
- A thread can be in the Runnable state even if it is not currently running (this depends on the availability of the CPU).

Example:
```java
t.start();  // Thread enters the runnable state.
```

 3. Blocked (Waiting for resources):
- A thread enters the Blocked state when it cannot run because it is waiting for a resource. This could be a resource like a file or a network connection.
- It may also occur if the thread is waiting for access to a synchronized block of code (if another thread is using it).

Example:
- A thread waits for a file to be available.
- Or a thread is waiting for another thread to finish and release a resource.

 4. Waiting (Idle state):
- A thread enters the Waiting state when it’s waiting for another thread to perform a specific action (like notifying or signaling).
- This is different from Blocked because the thread is not waiting for a resource but is just waiting for something else to happen.

- A thread can enter the Waiting state when methods like `wait()`, `join()`, or `sleep()` are called.

Example:
```java
t.join(); // The main thread waits for thread `t` to finish.
```
- The `join()` method causes the current thread (main thread) to wait until thread `t` finishes executing.

 5. Timed Waiting:
- A thread enters the Timed Waiting state when it’s waiting for a specific amount of time before it can proceed.
- For example, you might use `Thread.sleep()`, which tells a thread to wait for a certain number of milliseconds before it becomes eligible to run again.

Example:
```java
Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread sleeps for 1 second.
```

 6. Terminated (Dead state):
- A thread enters the Terminated state when it has finished executing its `run()` method or when it has been stopped (either because of an exception or because it completed its task).
- Once a thread has terminated, it can no longer be started again. A thread can only go through the life cycle once.

Example:
- Once the `run()` method completes or an unhandled exception occurs, the thread will enter the terminated state.

 7. Summary of the Thread Lifecycle:
1. New: Thread is created but not started.
2. Runnable: Thread is ready to run but may not be running yet (waiting for CPU).
3. Blocked: Thread is waiting for a resource or a lock to be released.
4. Waiting: Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action.
5. Timed Waiting: Thread is waiting for a fixed amount of time.
6. Terminated: Thread has finished executing.

 8. Diagram of Thread Life Cycle:
```plaintext
New -> Runnable -> (Running) -> Blocked/Waiting/Timed Waiting -> Terminated
```

 Key Methods Affecting Thread States:
- start(): Transitions a thread from New to Runnable.
- sleep(long millis): Puts the thread into Timed Waiting for the specified time.
- wait(), notify(), notifyAll(): Used to move threads between Waiting, Blocked, and Runnable.
- join(): Makes one thread wait for another thread to finish, putting the current thread into Waiting.
- interrupt(): Interrupts a thread that is sleeping, waiting, or blocked.
- stop(): This method is deprecated and should not be used. It is used to terminate a thread.

 Simple Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Timed waiting for 1 second
            System.out.println("Thread is running!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();  // Thread moves to Runnable state

        t.join(); // Main thread waits for MyThread to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread finished");
    }
}
```

 Conclusion:
- A thread goes through several states during its life cycle: New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.
- Each of these states represents a different phase in the thread’s execution, and you can manage these states using various methods like `start()`, `sleep()`, `wait()`, and `join()`.

====================================  Thread Synchronization =================================

 Java Thread Synchronization: Notes for Beginners

In Java, Thread Synchronization is the process of controlling access to shared resources (like variables, objects, or files) by multiple threads, ensuring that only one thread can access the resource at a time. This prevents issues like data inconsistency when two or more threads try to update shared data simultaneously.

Why Synchronization is Needed?
When multiple threads try to access and modify shared resources concurrently, it can lead to race conditions. A race condition happens when the program's outcome depends on the unpredictable order in which the threads execute. Synchronization helps ensure thread safety by preventing this.

 Key Concepts of Thread Synchronization

1. Critical Section: A part of the code where shared resources are accessed or modified. If multiple threads enter the critical section simultaneously, it can lead to problems like data corruption.

2. Race Condition: A situation in which the behavior of a program depends on the sequence or timing of threads, leading to unpredictable or incorrect results.

3. Thread Safety: Ensuring that a shared resource is accessed and modified by only one thread at a time, which avoids race conditions and ensures correctness.

 Types of Synchronization in Java

Java provides different ways to handle synchronization:

 1. Synchronized Method

You can make an entire method synchronized by using the `synchronized` keyword. When a method is synchronized, only one thread can execute that method at a time for a given object.

- Instance Method Synchronization: Locks the current object (`this`) so only one thread can execute that method at a time.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class TestSynchronization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Creating threads that will call the increment method
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });
        
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

- In the example above, both `t1` and `t2` will increment the `count` variable. Since the method `increment()` is synchronized, only one thread can execute it at a time for the same `counter` object.

 2. Synchronized Block

Sometimes, you don’t need to synchronize the whole method; you may only want to synchronize part of the method (the critical section). In this case, you can use a synchronized block.

- Synchronized block: You specify a block of code to be synchronized, and the lock is applied to an object (this object is called the lock object).

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Lock object

    // Synchronized block
    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

- Here, the synchronized block only locks the increment operation, not the whole method. This allows other parts of the method to run concurrently.

 3. Class-level Synchronization (Static Synchronization)

If you have static methods or static variables, the lock will be applied to the class object rather than the instance (`this`). This ensures that only one thread can execute any static synchronized method at a time.

```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    // Synchronized static method
    public static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

- Here, the `increment()` method is synchronized at the class level, meaning only one thread can execute this method for the class itself (not for an instance of the class).

 4. The `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` Methods

These methods are used for inter-thread communication, where one thread needs to wait for some condition to be met, and another thread notifies it when it's time to proceed.

- wait(): The current thread releases the lock and waits until it’s notified by another thread.
- notify(): Wakes up a single thread that is waiting.
- notifyAll(): Wakes up all threads that are waiting.

Example of `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Lock object

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++;
            lock.notify(); // Notify other threads waiting on the lock
        }
    }

    public void waitForCount() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            while (count < 5) {
                try {
                    lock.wait(); // Wait until count reaches 5
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Count reached 5!");
        }
    }
}

public class TestSynchronization {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Thread 1 will wait until count reaches 5
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> counter.waitForCount());
        
        // Thread 2 will increment the count
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
    }
}
```

- In this example:
  - `t1` will wait for the `count` to reach 5.
  - `t2` will increment the `count`, and once it reaches 5, `t1` will be notified and will continue.

 5. Deadlock

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock. It’s an undesirable condition that can freeze your program.

Example of a deadlock:
```java
class A {
    synchronized void methodA(B b) {
        b.last();
    }

    synchronized void last() {}
}

class B {
    synchronized void methodB(A a) {
        a.last();
    }

    synchronized void last() {}
}
```
- In this scenario, `Thread 1` holds a lock on object `A` and calls `methodA()`, which requires a lock on object `B`. At the same time, `Thread 2` holds a lock on object `B` and calls `methodB()`, which requires a lock on object `A`. This leads to a deadlock where neither thread can proceed.

 Best Practices for Synchronization

1. Use synchronization only when needed: Synchronization can slow down your program due to the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks. Only synchronize the parts of your code that actually require it.
   
2. Minimize the scope of synchronized blocks: Instead of synchronizing an entire method, try to synchronize only the critical section (the part that modifies shared data).

3. Avoid deadlock: Be careful when using multiple locks. Always acquire locks in a consistent order to avoid circular dependencies.

4. Use higher-level concurrency utilities: For complex thread management, consider using Java’s Executor Service and Concurrency Utilities (from `java.util.concurrent`), which provide better ways to manage threads and synchronization.

---

 Key Takeaways:

- Synchronized methods and synchronized blocks help to control access to shared resources and ensure thread safety.
- Deadlock can occur if threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release resources.
- wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() are used for inter-thread communication, letting one thread wait and another notify it to resume.
- Synchronization should be used carefully to avoid performance overhead and deadlocks.
