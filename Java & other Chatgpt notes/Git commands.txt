1. Create a .gitignore File
touch .gitignore

2. Add Patterns to Ignore Files
Inside .gitignore, you list the files/folders you want Git to ignore
# Ignore a specific file
secret.txt

# Ignore all .log files
*.log

# Ignore all files in a folder
node_modules/

# Ignore a file in a specific folder
temp/data.json

# Ignore all .env files (common for secrets)
.env
note -Comments: Use # to add comments in .gitignore

3. Commit the .gitignore File
Git needs to know about the .gitignore file itself, so add and commit it:

bash
Copy
Edit

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
