Sure! Let me break it down for you.

### What you have:

```java
private List<String> subjects;
```

Here, you have declared a **private** variable `subjects` which is a list of strings. This list will hold multiple **subject names** (for example, "Math", "Science", etc.).

### What your `toString()` method does:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return subjects.toString();
}
```

* The `@Override` annotation means you're overriding the `toString()` method that is inherited from the `Object` class. This method is called when you try to print an instance of your class, or when you try to convert an object into a string.

* `subjects.toString()` is calling the `toString()` method of the **`List<String>`** class. This method, by default, converts the list to a string representation where each element is enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. For example:

  * If `subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History"]`, the `toString()` method of the list would return `"[Math, Science, History]"`.

### How it works:

1. If you create an object of your class (which has the `subjects` list) and you print it using `System.out.println()` or any other string operation, Java will automatically call your overridden `toString()` method.

2. Inside your `toString()` method, you are returning the string representation of the `subjects` list using `subjects.toString()`.

   So, the output will look like this:

   ```java
   System.out.println(yourObject); // This will print the string form of the subjects list
   ```

   If `subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History"]`, the output will be:

   ```
   [Math, Science, History]
   ```

### In simple words:

* When you print your object, the `toString()` method is called.
* It returns the string representation of the `subjects` list, which is just a comma-separated list of the subject names in square brackets.

Does that clear things up?
