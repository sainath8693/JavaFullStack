Sure! Let‚Äôs now understand @Service in the same simple way as we did with @Component.

---

 üü° What is @Service?

@Service is just like @Component, but it tells Spring:

> ‚ÄúThis class contains business logic ‚Äî treat it as a service.‚Äù

It's a specialization of @Component, used to improve code readability and organization.

---

 üîß Why use @Service?

You use @Service when:

* The class contains core application logic (like calculations, processing data, etc.).
* You want to keep a clean structure: controller ‚Üí service ‚Üí repository.

 ‚úÖ Simple Example

java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class CalculatorService {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


Now use this service in another class:

java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyApp {

    @Autowired
    CalculatorService calculatorService;

    public void run() {
        int result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Prints: Result: 8
    }
}


Spring automatically creates the CalculatorService object and injects it into MyApp.

 üîç Difference Between @Component and @Service

| Aspect          | @Component           | @Service                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Meaning         | General-purpose bean   | Business logic / services      |
| Spring Behavior | Same                   | Same                           |
| Use Case        | Utility/helper classes | Core logic of your app         |
| Purpose         | Generic marker         | Semantic (easier to read code) |

‚ö†Ô∏è Both are detected by Spring‚Äôs component scanning ‚Äî the difference is mainly for readability and intent.

 üß± Typical App Structure

plaintext
Controller (web/API logic)      ‚Üí   @Controller
Service (business logic)        ‚Üí   @Service
Repository (database logic)     ‚Üí   @Repository
Helper/Utils/Other beans        ‚Üí   @Component
